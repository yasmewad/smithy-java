/**
 * A trait that marks operations as proxies to delegate operations.
 * 
 * <p>Operations annotated with this trait are treated as proxies to the 
 * delegate operation specified by this trait. Proxy operations enable 
 * additional input processing while maintaining compatibility with the 
 * original operation interface.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Proxy Operation Input Handling</h3>
 * <p>Proxy operation inputs are expected to be a superset of the original 
 * operation input. For operations with existing input, a new input structure 
 * is created that contains all original input members plus an 
 * {@code additionalInput} field containing the additional parameters. For 
 * operations with no input, the additional input structure is used directly.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Additional Input Access</h3>
 * <p>The additional input data can be accessed in Dynamic client interceptors 
 * using the {@code ProxyService.PROXY_INPUT} context key. This enables 
 * interceptors to process the extra data before the request is forwarded 
 * to the delegate service.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Input Stripping</h3>
 * <p>The proxy service automatically strips out the additional input before 
 * sending the request to the delegate service, ensuring that only the 
 * expected input parameters are forwarded to the original operation.</p>
 * 
 * @see ProxyService#PROXY_INPUT
